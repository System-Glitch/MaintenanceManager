Maintenance Manager is the ultimate maintenance plugin which makes maintenances times on your server way easier! For the moment, it provides several exclusivities I havn't found anywhere else. It is very simple to use and to configure (even if the configuration is optionnal). I want to make it the best maintenance plugin for Bukkit!

Current version: 2.0

---> [Download](https://app.box.com/s/mi19fcbpta2p19islpuo3qtewmzdvyh3) <---

#Features:

  * /maintenance command manages the maintenance time: /maintenance on|off
  * Maintenance schedule. Schedule your maintenance time and advert players with /maintenance on (time before maintenance time) (Optionnal, in minutes)
  * Schedule interruption with /maintenance cancel.
  * Define the duration of your maintenance with /maintenance on [time before maintenance time] <duration> (Optionnal, in minutes)
  * Kicks non-op players and players who don't have the permission to log-in during the maintenance.
  * Prevents non authorized players to log-in during maintenance.
  * Changes the motd on the multi-player screen when the server is in maintenance.
  *  Commands can be casted from console or in-game.
  * Custom server icon for maintenance.
  * Server reload support.
  * You can reload the config without restarting the server or reloading it entirely with /maintenance reload.
  * Full permissions supported.
  * Full texts customization.
  * You can choose the number of slots available during a maintenance.
  * Manage your plugins in real-time without having to reload or restart the server with /maintenance (enable|disable) (plugin name). Disabled plugins stay disabled after restart or reload until you re-enable it.
  * Countdown in motd when a maintenance has a duration planned.
  * Aliases on /maintenance command. See the Commands section for further informations.
  * Backups on command. 

#Commands:

/maintenance is the main command. You'll have to add the following arguments:

Aliases: /mmode , /maint

  * on: turn on the maintenance mode
    * <schedule in minutes> (optionnal) Note: The schedule would cancel if you reload the server before the maintenance begin.
      * <duration of the maintenance in minutes> (optionnal) 
  * cancel: cancels a scheduled maintenance.
  * off: turn off the maintenance mode
  * reload: reload the plugin's config file
  * enable <plugin name>: enable the selected plugin.
  * disable <plugin name>: disable the selected plugin. Note: If you are not sure about the plugin name, type /plugins.
  * backup: Saves the server folder into a zip file located in the "backups" folder.

```

To set your custom icon for maintenances, just put an image named maintenance-icon.png in the main folder of your server. The default one auto-creates if the plugins doesn't find any maintenance-icon.png in that folder. Note: Your icon must be a 64X64 png image!

Advice: If you don't want to change the icon, copy-paste server-icon.png and rename it into maintenance-icon.png

Important: If your server is running without icon, maintenance-icon.png will be displayed even out of a maintenance!

To add colors to your texts, just put '§' and a character from 0-9 and a-f before the words you want to color. Please refer you to this page to know formatting codes.
Setup:

To set up Maintenance Manager, simply download the jar file and put it into "plugins" folder. And now enjoy the uniqueness of MaintenanceManager!
